# Progress

The one file that says where grooph is right now. The driver rewrites it after every handback; implementers append to the **In flight** entry for their slice.

## Now

- **Stage:** 0–5 and 7 are done. Stage 6 (proving ground) is under way: the first batch found seven defects in what grooph emits; slice 0010 fixed them and re-proved the two gate templates clean. Next is the second batch (slice 0011, the remaining eleven templates).
- **Live:** app https://ryanjosephkamp.github.io/grooph/ · templates https://ryanjosephkamp.github.io/grooph/patterns/index.json · proving runs https://ryanjosephkamp.github.io/grooph/experiments/patterns/ledger.json (write-ups are in the repo under `experiments/patterns/`)
- **Next action (owner):** confirm slice 0011 and paste its prompt into an Opus 5 implementer session.
- **What works today:** everything through slice 0007, plus: `grooph runs list | show | bundle`, `grooph adopt`, `grooph share <run>`, `grooph watch` (local monitor; `--host` for the phone on the same network); the run view in the app (states on the canvas, timeline, what the run changed, adopt or discard, apply a proposal to a copy, pin notes, the stop that fired); `dispatches` budgets end to end; `scripts/prove-pattern.sh` with a spend ledger and `--strict-mcp-config`; eight real run records.

## In flight

_(none)_

## Waiting on the owner

| Item | Recommended answer |
|---|---|
| Confirm slice 0011 (`handoffs/0011-proving-batch-two/HANDOFF.md`): the remaining eleven templates on tasks built to force a back edge, under the $45.00 cap ($34.19 left) | Yes |

## Deferred until Codex is available

- Slice 0003, Astra's read-only harness-neutrality review (handoff already drafted). Runs before stage 9.
- Stages 9–11 (Codex target, paired empirical runs, dual-harness nodes).

## Done

| Date | What |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-20 | Owner raised the proving ledger cap to $45.00; handoff 0011 drafted. |
| 2026-09-20 | Slice 0010 reconciled and merged: lead brief and agent files agree with graph-ir (evidence plus inputs, one gate rule, clock run ids and timestamps, `dispatches` budgets, `invalid-evidence` routing, `stop` on loop notes), eleven templates hardened, `review-gate` and `spec-then-loop` re-proved clean for $3.80 (ledger $10.81 of $25.00). `docs/templates.md` §5 reconciled. |
| 2026-09-20 | Project picked up on a new Claude account per `docs/HANDOVER.md`; nothing needed recreating. Owner confirmed slice 0010 and approved its two re-proving runs. Handover page republished from the new account, URL recorded in `handoffs/briefs/`. |
| 2026-09-19 | Slices 0008 (runs: notes back, adoption, monitor) and 0009 (proving ground, five templates, $7.01) reconciled and merged. Findings folded into graph-ir (one gate rule, `dispatches` budgets, `invalid-evidence` routing, `stop` on loop notes, clock timestamps), the target doc (run ids from the clock, cost cap flag) and runs.md. Proving records published with the site. |
| 2026-09-19 | Slice 0007 merged after fix pass 1: templates in the app, undo/redo, storage persistence, docked toolbar, rename warning, compare view opens on the recommendation, nearest-writer critic rule. First slice built by a grooph run; first working copy adopted (v2). Skill gained two lessons (point at sources of truth; give critics the repository). |
| 2026-09-18 | Slice 0006 reconciled and merged: proposal sets, share links, compare view, `grooph share/pick/shape`, plugin manifests, local install script. Skill revised from the implementer's notes. Driver ran the skill end to end for slice 0007's workflow; link verified on the live site. |
| 2026-09-18 | Slice 0005 reconciled and merged: template block and operations, registries and `grooph template …`, sixteen patterns with generated index, library published with the site. `docs/executive.md` and the `grooph-design` skill written by the driver. |
| 2026-09-18 | Slice 0004 reconciled and merged: operations in core with `applyOps`, all §3 rules with fixtures, adaptation in document and compiler, `grooph new/apply`, second golden, acceptance run passed ($2.12). Ambiguities resolved in graph-ir; `docs/templates.md` written with the sixteen pattern specifications. |
| 2026-09-18 | Owner's phone session closed stage 2. Plan reordered around agent-built graphs; A-008 (adaptive by default, brakes fixed) and A-009 (agents author) logged; decisions 0007 and 0008; run monitor and community gallery placed as later stages. |
| 2026-09-18 | Slice 0002 reconciled and merged: web canvas over the unchanged core; 40 unit tests and 10 phone-size browser tests, including a byte-for-byte package round trip; GitHub Pages enabled and first deploy verified live. Decision 0006 recorded. |
| 2026-09-18 | Owner confirmed slice 0002; Codex-dependent work (0003, stages 7–9) deferred until the owner's Codex quota returns. |
| 2026-09-18 | Slice 0001 reconciled and merged: core (schema, validator, canonical form, Claude Code compiler), CLI, fixtures per ★ code, golden package, CI, headless acceptance run passed. Eight implementer findings folded into `graph-ir.md` and `targets/claude-code.md`; decision 0005 recorded. |
| 2026-09-17 | Owner confirmed slice 0001; MIT license added. |
| 2026-09-17 | Stage 1: graph document v0 designed (`graph-ir.md`), Claude Code target mapping (`targets/claude-code.md`), example fixtures. |
| 2026-09-17 | Stage 0: repo scaffolding, spec + amendments, living docs, handoff protocol, project skills. |
| 2026-09-17 | Phase A alignment: platform, executive location, phone-to-run path and slice order decided (see `PLAN.md`). |

## Known risks

- Real-finger pinch, drag and on-screen keyboard behaviour is untested; only browser touch emulation has run.
- One acceptance run is one data point: a small graph, one harness version, one model. Fan-out, `shared` isolation, check nodes and larger graphs are unexercised.
- Claude Code native units change between releases. `targets/claude-code.md` pins what was verified (2.1.268) and when.
- `dispatches` is the lead's own count; both re-proving leads kept it correctly, but nothing checks it yet. `turns`, `usd` and `tokens` are advisory inside a session.
- Leads reach for compound shell forms (`cd … &&`, `git -C`) that the proving allowlist refuses: a turn per refusal, and once a critic's diff. Not a package defect, but it skews batch-two costs until the kickoff says to run commands bare.
